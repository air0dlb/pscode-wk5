// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

function checkEvenorOdd(number):
	if number mod 2 == 0 then
		return "Even"
	else
		return "Odd"


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

// Step a: Read in 5 separate numbers
numbers[5]  // Array to store the 5 numbers
for i = 1 to 5 do
    input "Enter number " + i + ": "
    read numbers[i]

// Step b: Calculate the average of the five numbers
sum = 0
for i = 1 to 5 do
    sum = sum + numbers[i]
average = sum / 5

// Step c: Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers
min = numbers[1]
max = numbers[1]
for i = 2 to 5 do
    if numbers[i] < min then
        min = numbers[i]
    if numbers[i] > max then
        max = numbers[i]

// Step d: Write out the results
output "The average of the five numbers is: " + average
output "The smallest number entered is: " + min
output "The largest number entered is: " + max
